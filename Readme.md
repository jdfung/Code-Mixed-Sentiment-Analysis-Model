# Getting Started

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at developing a Sentiment Classification Model specifically designed for code-mixed English-Malay sentences. The model is trained to accurately classify sentiments into categories such as positive and negative, addressing the unique challenges posed by code-mixed language inputs.

## Features
- Code-Mixed Data Handling: Efficiently processes and understands sentences with mixed English and Malay language, a common occurrence in multilingual communities.
- Sentiment Analysis: Utilizes state-of-the-art algorithms to determine the sentiment of a given text.
- Manually Collected Dataset: Includes a curated dataset of code-mixed English-Malay sentences with annotated sentiment labels.
- Preprocessing Pipeline: Comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline tailored for code-mixed language, including tokenization, normalization, and language-specific handling.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Scripts for training the model and evaluating its performance using various metrics.
